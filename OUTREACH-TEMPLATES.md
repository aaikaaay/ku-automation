## LinkedIn Connection Message (under 300 chars)

Hi [Name], hope you're well! After 21 years in oil & gas engineering, I've started helping engineering teams automate their document workflows with AI. Would love to catch up and hear what you're working on. Free for a quick call this week?

Hey [Name]!

Hope things are going well at [Company]. It's been a while since our [DNO/TechnipFMC/Wood] days.

Quick update from my end — I've been building AI automation tools specifically for engineering teams. Stuff like:
- Extracting data from P&IDs and datasheets automatically
- Chatbots trained on technical manuals
- Auto-generating reports from project data

Basically solving the "engineers spend too much time on paperwork" problem.

If your team is drowning in documentation, I'd love to show you what's possible. No sales pitch — just a 20-min demo.

Either way, would be great to catch up. Free this week?

Best,
Kingsley

## LinkedIn DM — Cold Contact (decision maker)

Hi [Name],

I came across your profile — looks like you're leading engineering at [Company]. 

I spent 21 years in oil & gas (DNO, TechnipFMC, Wood Group) and saw firsthand how much time engineers lose to documentation. Now I'm helping teams automate that with AI.

One client saved 25 hours/week just by automating their datasheet extraction.

If you're curious what's possible, I'd be happy to do a quick 20-min walkthrough — no commitment. 

Worth a look?

## Email — Warm Contact

**Subject:** Quick question + something you might find useful

```
Hi [Name],

Hope you're doing well! It's been a minute since [context — when you worked together].

I wanted to reach out because I've been working on something that might be relevant to what you're doing at [Company].

After years of watching engineering teams (including my own) lose countless hours to documentation, I started building AI automation tools specifically for our industry:

• Automatic data extraction from P&IDs and technical documents
• Chatbots trained on your standards and procedures
• Report generation that takes minutes instead of hours

The early results have been pretty wild — one team cut their document processing time by 70%.

I'd love to show you a quick demo (20 minutes, no pitch). If nothing else, it might give you some ideas for your own team.

Free for a call this week or next?

Best,

## Email — Cold Contact

**Subject:** Saving engineering teams from documentation hell

```
Hi [Name],

Quick question: how much time does your engineering team spend on documentation vs. actual engineering?

If the answer makes you wince, you're not alone. I spent 21 years in oil & gas (DNO, TechnipFMC, Wood Group) and lived that reality.

Now I'm helping engineering teams automate the tedious stuff with AI:
- Extract data from P&IDs, datasheets, specs automatically
- Get instant answers from technical manuals via AI chatbot
- Generate reports in minutes instead of hours

No generic AI tools — these are built specifically for how engineering teams actually work.

I'm offering a free 20-minute walkthrough for teams interested in seeing what's possible. No commitment, no sales pressure.

Worth a look?

## Follow-Up Email (3-5 days after no response)

**Subject:** Re: [original subject]

```
Hi [Name],

Just bumping this in case it got buried. 

Happy to keep it super quick — even 15 minutes works if you're slammed.

Let me know if there's a better time, or if this isn't a priority right now (totally understand).

## Phone Script (for warm calls)

```
"Hey [Name], it's Kingsley — we worked together at [Company]. 
Got a minute?

[If yes]

Great, I'll be quick. So I've been building AI tools for engineering teams — 
automating the documentation grind that eats up so much time.

Things like extracting data from P&IDs automatically, chatbots trained on 
technical manuals, auto-generating reports.

I thought of you because [specific reason — their role, company, past conversations].

Would you be open to a quick 20-minute demo? No pitch, just showing you what's 
possible. Might give you some ideas even if it's not a fit right now.

[If interested] Great, how's [suggest 2 times]?
[If not now] No problem — mind if I send you a quick email with more info? 
You can check it out when things calm down.
