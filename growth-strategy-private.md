# KU Automation — Private Growth Strategy

**Effective:** February 2026
**Context:** Shifted from public LinkedIn promotion to private channels

---

## Growth Channels (Priority Order)

### 1. Cold Email Outreach (Primary)
- **Tools:** Instantly.ai, Apollo, Smartlead
- **Volume:** 50-100 emails/day
- **Targets:** Engineering managers, Document control leads, Operations directors
- **Sequences:** Use `email-nurture-sequence.md` (5 emails over 14 days)

### 2. LinkedIn Direct Messages (Secondary)
- **Approach:** Connection → DM sequence (no public posts)
- **Volume:** 20-30 new connections/day
- **Sequences:** Use `linkedin-dm-sequence.md` (4 messages over 10 days)
- **Note:** Personal profile stays clean — no promotional content

### 3. Referrals & Network
- **Leverage:** Former colleagues, industry contacts
- **Ask:** "Know anyone drowning in document work?"
- **Incentive:** Consider referral fee for closed deals

### 4. Industry Events (Long-term)
- **Target:** SPE, ADIPEC, OTC conferences
- **Approach:** Networking, not booth/sponsorship
- **Goal:** Build relationships, not immediate sales
