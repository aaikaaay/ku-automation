## LinkedIn Connection Request (300 chars max)

```
Hi [Name], I noticed your work at [Company] in [oil & gas/EPC/engineering]. I help engineering firms automate document-heavy processes using AI — turning 40% of wasted admin time into productive work. Would love to connect and share some insights.
```

## Follow-Up Message 1 (After Connection - Day 2)

```
Thanks for connecting, [Name]!

Quick question: How much time does your team spend on repetitive document tasks — extracting data from datasheets, checking compliance, processing vendor docs?

I ask because we've helped similar firms cut that by 70%+ using AI automation.

Not trying to sell anything — just curious if this is a pain point for you too.

Best,
Kingsley

## Follow-Up Message 2 (Day 5 - If No Response)

```
Hi [Name],

One more thought — I put together a quick case study on how an EPC firm automated their equipment datasheet processing. Went from 4 hours per project to 20 minutes.

Happy to share if useful. No strings attached.

Cheers,
Kingsley

## Follow-Up Message 3 (Day 10 - The Value-First Close)

```
[Name], 

I know you're busy, so I'll keep this brief.

I created a free ROI calculator that shows exactly how much AI automation could save your team — just plug in your numbers.

If the numbers look interesting, happy to do a quick 15-min call to discuss. If not, no worries at all.

Either way, best of luck with everything at [Company].

## Email Alternative (If LinkedIn Not Possible)

**Subject:** Quick question about [Company]'s document processes

```
Hi [Name],

I'll keep this short.

Engineers at EPC firms typically spend 40% of their time on admin tasks — pulling data from datasheets, checking specs, processing vendor documents.

At KU Automation, we use AI to automate these processes. One client reduced their equipment data entry from 4 hours to 20 minutes per project.

I'm not sure if this is a priority for [Company] right now, but I'd be happy to share:
- A quick case study from a similar firm
- A free ROI calculator to see if it makes sense for you

Would a brief 15-minute call be useful? If not, no problem — just thought it was worth reaching out.

Best regards,
