# KU Automation — Email Nurture Sequence

**Purpose:** Convert cold leads/website visitors into discovery calls
**Timing:** 5 emails over 14 days
**Target:** Engineering managers, Operations directors, Document control leads

## Email 1: The Problem (Day 0)
**Subject:** Your engineers are doing admin work

Hi {{First_Name}},

I've worked with engineering teams for 20+ years. One pattern I see constantly:

Your most expensive resource (engineers) spending 40% of their time on:
- Hunting through P&IDs for equipment data
- Manually extracting specs from datasheets
- Copy-pasting between systems

That's not engineering. That's admin work at engineer prices.

We help EPC and oil & gas companies automate this with AI — so your team focuses on actual engineering.

Curious how much time your team loses to document work?

P.S. Reply with your biggest document headache — I'll tell you if AI can fix it.

## Email 2: The Proof (Day 3)
**Subject:** 4 hours → 12 minutes

{{First_Name}},

Quick example of what AI document processing looks like:

**P&ID Data Extraction**
- Before: 4 hours per drawing, manual transcription
- After: 12 minutes, 98% accuracy, straight to your database

**RFQ Analysis**
- Before: Senior engineer, 2 days per tender
- After: AI summary + compliance matrix in 30 minutes

**Datasheet Parsing**
- Before: Copy-paste nightmare across 50-page specs
- After: Structured data, auto-populated templates

These aren't future promises — this is working today.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if it fits your workflow?

## Email 3: The Objection Handler (Day 6)
**Subject:** "We tried AI before..."

{{First_Name}},

I hear this a lot: "We tried ChatGPT / we have IT working on it / it didn't work for us."

Here's the difference:

Generic AI tools fail on engineering documents because:
- They don't understand P&ID symbols
- They hallucinate equipment specs
- They can't handle your specific standards

Our systems are trained specifically on:
- ISO/PIP piping standards
- Equipment datasheets (pumps, valves, vessels)
- Your company's document templates

We validate outputs against your existing systems — no hallucinations, no guessing.

If you've been burned before, I get it. That's why we do a free pilot:
- Your actual documents
- Your actual workflow
- Measurable results before you pay anything

Interested in testing with real data?

## Email 4: The Case Study (Day 10)
**Subject:** How [Industry Peer] saved 120 hours/month

{{First_Name}},

Quick case study from a company like yours:

**The Challenge:**
EPC firm with 50+ active projects, drowning in document admin. Engineers spending 3+ days per week on data entry and document searches.

**What We Built:**
- AI P&ID parser → auto-extracts equipment lists
- Smart search across 10,000+ datasheets
- RFQ analyzer with compliance checking

**The Results:**
- 120 hours/month freed up
- 3-week reduction in project setup time
- ROI positive in 6 weeks

I'd love to understand your specific challenges and see if we can replicate these results.

15 minutes this week?

## Email 5: The Breakup (Day 14)
**Subject:** Should I close your file?

{{First_Name}},

I've sent a few emails about automating engineering document work — haven't heard back.

Totally fine if the timing isn't right. I'll assume one of these:

1. **Not a priority right now** — I'll check back in 6 months
2. **Wrong person** — Point me to who handles process improvement?
3. **Already solved** — Congrats! Would love to hear how
4. **Interested but swamped** — Just reply "later" and I'll follow up next quarter

No hard feelings either way. Just want to make sure I'm not clogging your inbox.
