## WEEK 1: ESTABLISHING AUTHORITY (Feb 9-15)

---

### POST 1 - Monday, February 9
**Topic:** The Engineer's Time Problem  
**Format:** Text + Carousel (5-7 slides)

---

Your engineers didn't spend 4+ years in university to copy data between spreadsheets.

Yet that's exactly what's happening in most engineering companies right now.

I recently spoke with a piping lead who told me:
"I spend 40% of my day on documentation."

Forty. Percent.

That's not engineering. That's expensive data entry.

Here's what I've learned after 21+ years in oil & gas:

The best engineers aren't faster at admin.
They've automated it away.

In the next few weeks, I'll be sharing exactly how AI is changing this - and what you can do about it today.

Follow along if you're tired of watching talent waste time on tasks a machine could do.

### POST 2 - Wednesday, February 11
**Topic:** Personal Story - Why I Started KU Automation  
**Format:** Text + Personal Photo

---

21 years ago, I started as a junior engineer.

Today, I run an AI automation company.

Here's the moment everything changed:

I was leading a team at TechnipFMC. A critical project deadline was approaching. And my best engineers were stuck... copying data from PDFs into Excel.

For days.

I remember thinking: "This is insane."

These are CEng-qualified professionals. People who can design complex piping systems. People who solve problems that matter.

And they're doing cut-and-paste.

That frustration never left me.

When AI tools became practical, I knew exactly what to build:

Automation that actually understands engineering.

Not generic chatbots that hallucinate P&ID data.
Not enterprise software that takes 18 months to implement.

Real solutions. Built by someone who's been in those trenches.

That's why I started KU Automation.

If you're an engineering leader watching your team drown in admin, let's talk.

### POST 3 - Friday, February 13
**Topic:** Quick Tip - The 2-Hour Rule  
**Format:** Text Only (Engagement Post)

---

Simple rule I give every engineering manager:

If your team does the same task for 2+ hours every week?

It can probably be automated.

Here's how to find these tasks:

1. Ask your team: "What do you hate doing?"
2. Track time for one week (brutal honesty)
3. Look for anything involving: copying, formatting, or "updating the spreadsheet"

Most teams find 10-15 hours of automatable work per person per week.

That's not a small efficiency gain.

That's getting a whole extra person without hiring anyone.

What repetitive task drives your team crazy?

(Drop it in the comments - I'll tell you if AI can fix it)

## WEEK 2: EDUCATION & VALUE (Feb 16-22)

---

### POST 4 - Monday, February 16
**Topic:** The P&ID Data Extraction Problem  
**Format:** Text + Before/After Video or Carousel

---

Here's a challenge every piping engineer knows:

You receive a 200-page P&ID package.

Your job: Extract all valve data into a master equipment list.

Traditional approach:
• Open PDF
• Squint at symbols
• Type into Excel
• Repeat 500 times
• Make 47 errors
• Spend 2 days fixing errors

Time: 3-4 days

AI approach:
• Upload PDFs
• Review extracted data
• Fix 3-4 edge cases
• Export to Excel

Time: 2-3 hours

Same deliverable. 90% less time. Fewer errors.

This isn't science fiction. This is what we're building at KU Automation.

Want to see it in action? Drop "DEMO" in the comments.

### POST 5 - Wednesday, February 18
**Topic:** Industry Insight - AI Adoption in Engineering  
**Format:** Text + Statistic Graphic

---

I've been talking to engineering leaders across oil & gas, EPC, and construction.

Here's what I'm seeing:

70% say they need AI automation.
15% have actually implemented it.
5% are seeing real ROI.

Why the gap?

Three reasons:

1. **Fear of the unknown** - "What if it makes mistakes?"
(Reality: It makes fewer mistakes than tired humans)

2. **Vendor complexity** - Enterprise AI takes 12-18 months to implement
(Reality: Focused solutions can deploy in weeks)

3. **Not built for engineering** - Generic AI doesn't understand our world
(Reality: You need domain-specific solutions)

The companies closing this gap aren't waiting for perfect.

They're starting with ONE workflow. ONE process. ONE pain point.

Then scaling what works.

What's your biggest barrier to AI adoption?

### POST 6 - Friday, February 20
**Topic:** Quick Win - Automating Daily Reports  
**Format:** Text + Screenshot/Demo

---

True story from last month:

An engineering manager spent 45 minutes every morning compiling a daily progress report.

Same format. Same sources. Same process.

45 minutes × 5 days × 52 weeks = 195 hours/year

On one report.

We automated it in a week.

Now it runs at 6 AM automatically. He reviews and sends in 5 minutes.

Annual time saved: 173 hours

That's more than 4 full work weeks back.

This is what I mean by "start small."

One report. One automation. Massive impact.

What report do you dread creating?

**📸 SUGGESTED VISUAL:** Screenshot of automated report (sanitized) or mock-up showing before/after workflow.

**🎬 VIDEO OPTION:** Quick screen recording of the automation running + clean output.

## WEEK 3: SOCIAL PROOF & CASE STUDIES (Feb 23-28)

---

### POST 7 - Monday, February 23
**Topic:** What Generic AI Gets Wrong About Engineering  
**Format:** Text + Comparison Carousel

---

I tested ChatGPT on a simple engineering task:

"Extract the design pressure from this equipment datasheet."

Its answer: Made up a number that wasn't on the page.

Then I tested our engineering-specific AI on the same task.

Result: Correct value, with the cell reference and confidence score.

Here's the difference:

Generic AI is trained on the internet.
Engineering AI is trained on engineering documents.

Generic AI guesses when uncertain.
Engineering AI flags uncertainty and asks for review.

Generic AI hallucinates P&ID data.
Engineering AI knows what a P&ID actually is.

If you're evaluating AI tools for your team, this distinction matters.

A lot.

**📊 CAROUSEL OPTION:**
1. "Why Generic AI Fails for Engineering" (title)
2. ChatGPT test example (redacted)
3. Engineering AI test example

### POST 8 - Wednesday, February 25
**Topic:** The ROI Conversation  
**Format:** Text + Calculator Link

---

Every engineering leader asks the same question:

"What's the ROI?"

Fair question. Here's how we calculate it:

**Step 1: Find the hours**
How many hours/week does your team spend on the target task?

**Step 2: Calculate the cost**
Hours × (average hourly rate including overhead)

**Step 3: Estimate automation impact**
Most document processing tasks = 70-80% time reduction
Most report generation = 80-90% time reduction

**Step 4: Do the math**
If 5 engineers spend 5 hours/week each on data entry:
• 25 hours × $100/hour = $2,500/week
• 80% reduction = $2,000/week saved
• $104,000/year in recovered productivity

Against a $5,000 one-time investment?

That's 20x ROI in year one.

Most clients see payback in 2-4 weeks.

### POST 11 - Wednesday, March 4
**Topic:** FAQ - Common Concerns Addressed  
**Format:** Text + Q&A Carousel

---

Questions I get every week:

**"Is AI accurate enough for engineering?"**
With domain-specific training: yes. We build in human review for critical data. You stay in control.

**"How long does implementation take?"**
2-4 weeks for most solutions. Not 18 months like enterprise software.

**"What if our documents are in weird formats?"**
We've handled PDFs from the 90s, scanned drawings, and everything in between. Format flexibility is built in.

**"Do we need IT involvement?"**
Minimal. Most solutions run in the cloud with simple browser access. No infrastructure changes.

**"What's the minimum team size?"**
We work with teams of 5 to 500. The ROI math works at any scale.

**"What if it doesn't work for us?"**
We start with a pilot. If it doesn't deliver value, you don't pay for the full implementation. Simple.

### POST 12 - Friday, March 6
**Topic:** Week in Review + Weekend Thought  
**Format:** Text Only (Personal/Reflective)

---

Friday reflection:

This week I spoke with 4 engineering managers.

All 4 said the same thing:

"We know we need to automate. We just don't know where to start."

Here's what I told each of them:

Start with pain.

Not with technology.
Not with what's trendy.
Not with what the vendor is selling.

Start with the task your team dreads.
The one they complain about.
The one that makes talented people feel like data entry clerks.

That's your automation opportunity.

Technology is just the tool.
Pain is the compass.

Have a great weekend, everyone.

What's the task YOUR team dreads?
