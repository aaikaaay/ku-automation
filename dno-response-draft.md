Hi [Manager's Name],

Thank you for bringing this to my attention.

I have taken the following actions:

## Option B: If They Ask for More Detail

```
Subject: Re: LinkedIn Content — Confirmation

Hi [Manager's Name],

Further to our conversation, I want to confirm the following steps I've taken:

1. **LinkedIn Content:** All posts related to external engineering services have been removed from my personal profile.

2. **Website References:** My personal project website has been updated to remove any references to DNO or my current employment.

3. **Going Forward:** I will ensure any personal projects remain clearly separate from my role at DNO and will not use company time, resources, or branding.

I understand the importance of maintaining appropriate boundaries and appreciate you bringing this to my attention.

Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Best regards,
Kingsley Uzowulu

## Key Points to Remember

- **Don't over-explain** — Keep it factual and brief
- **Don't be defensive** — Show cooperation
- **Don't promise to stop the business** — Only promise to separate it from DNO
- **Don't apologize excessively** — Acknowledge and move on
- **Document everything** — Keep copies of all communications

---

## If They Push Further

If DNO requests you stop the side business entirely:
1. **Check your employment contract** for non-compete clauses
2. **Consult with a lawyer** if needed
3. **Consider:** Is the relationship worth the conflict?

Most companies are satisfied with separation, not shutdown.
