## Value Proposition

### Core Promise
> "We help engineering teams save 20+ hours per week by automating document processing with AI — so engineers can focus on engineering, not paperwork."

### Pain Points We Solve

| Pain Point | Impact | Our Solution |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| Manual data extraction from P&IDs | 2-4 hrs per drawing | P&ID Parser (30 seconds) |
| Copying specs from datasheets | 15-30 mins per sheet | Datasheet Parser (30 seconds) |
| Searching through manuals | Hours of frustration | Knowledge Bot (instant) |
| Writing repetitive reports | Full day each week | Report Generator |
| New hire onboarding | Weeks of shadowing | AI-trained on your docs |

### ROI Messaging

**The Math:**
- 5 engineers × 8 hrs/week on docs = 40 hrs/week
- AI saves 50-70% = 20-28 hrs/week saved
- At $75/hr loaded cost = $1,500-2,100/week
- **Monthly savings: $6,000-8,400**
- **$5,000 package pays for itself in < 1 month**

### Social Proof (to build)
- [ ] 3 case studies with metrics
- [ ] Video testimonials
