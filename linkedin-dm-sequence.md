# KU Automation — LinkedIn DM Sequence

**Purpose:** Convert LinkedIn connections into discovery calls
**Best for:** After they accept connection request
**Timing:** 4 messages over 10 days

---

## Connection Request (Day 0)
**Note:** Keep under 300 characters

Hi {{First_Name}} — Fellow engineer here (CEng, 21yrs in oil & gas/EPC). I'm now building AI tools that automate document work for engineering teams. Would love to connect and share ideas.

---

## DM 1: The Opener (Day 1 — after they accept)

Thanks for connecting, {{First_Name}}!

Quick question: How much time does your team spend hunting through P&IDs or extracting data from datasheets?

I ask because we've been helping engineering companies automate that grunt work with AI — turning hours into minutes.

Curious if document processing is a pain point for your team?

---

## DM 2: The Value Drop (Day 4)

{{First_Name}}, thought you might find this useful:

We just published a breakdown of how AI is changing document workflows in EPC:
- P&ID data extraction: 4 hours → 12 minutes
- RFQ analysis: 2 days → 30 minutes
- Datasheet parsing: fully automated

If you ever want to chat about what's possible for your team, happy to share what's working.

---

## DM 3: The Direct Ask (Day 7)

{{First_Name}}, I'll be direct:

We help engineering teams stop wasting senior talent on document admin.

If your team spends more than 10 hours/week on:
- Manual data extraction
- Document searching
- Copy-pasting between systems

...we can probably cut that in half.

Worth a 15-min call to see if it fits?

---

## DM 4: The Soft Close (Day 10)

Hey {{First_Name}} — just circling back.

If the timing isn't right, no worries at all. But if document automation is something you'd want to explore later this quarter, just say the word.

Either way, happy to stay connected and share useful content when I come across it.

Cheers,
Kingsley

## Pro Tips

### Response Handling:

**If they ask "What do you do exactly?"**
> We build custom AI systems that automate document work for engineering companies — things like P&ID extraction, datasheet parsing, RFQ analysis. Basically, we turn hours of manual work into minutes. Want me to show you a quick demo?

**If they say "Not right now"**
> Totally understand. Mind if I check back in Q2? And feel free to reach out if anything changes.

**If they say "Send me more info"**
> Happy to! Here's our one-pager: [link]
> Also, our ROI calculator might be useful: [link]
> If any of that resonates, I'd love to do a quick 15-min call to understand your specific workflow.

**If they're skeptical**
> Completely fair. We do free pilots with real documents so you can see results before committing anything. Would that work?

### Best Times to Send:
- Tuesday-Thursday
- 8-10am or 4-6pm (recipient's timezone)
- Avoid Mondays and Fridays

### Volume Targets:
- 50-100 connections/week
- Expect 30-40% accept rate
- Expect 10-15% reply rate
- Target: 3-5 calls/week from LinkedIn alone
